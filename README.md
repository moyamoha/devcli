This is a very simple cli I built to practice python

### How to get started

- First create a virtual environment and activate it. [See Here how](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)
- Then run command

```shell
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- run command

```shell
python dev.py --help
```
